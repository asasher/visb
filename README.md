# Rock DJ

A simple app to play music from Spotify with the ability to add slices that should not be played.
It also shows analysis of tracks like BPM and beats etc.

## TODO

- [ ] Add mark for each BAR.
- [ ] Add smaller mark for each BEAT.
- [ ] Show playlist and the queue with BPMs.
- [ ] Quickly cycle through the playlist once to have the songs pre-loaded for playback.
